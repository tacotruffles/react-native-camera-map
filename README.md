### React Native Version:

Make sure you have Xcode 9.x installed and then revert your react-native package to 0.54 after project setup, or use the instructor's package.json to npm install the project at the beginning. This will make installing all add-on modules go much easier for IOS. (as of this writing 0.55 is the current RN release and does not work with most of the 3rd party modules)  While I was able to get by with Xcode 8 and manual package versioning when adding 3rd party native modules, I lost a lot of time in the process; upgrading fixed all of my issues.

Also, do NOT use hyphens in your project name on project init, this really causes problems with builds on both Android and Xcode, which you can work around at the beginning but is a pain to manage.
